# Weather-App
This React.js weather app uses a weather API to display current weather info based on user input.  Created to further expand my knowledge in ReactJS 
Code has an error. Comment out lines 35 and 36 in the first div. Then refresh localhost. After doing so comment those lines back in.
Program should now be working properly.
